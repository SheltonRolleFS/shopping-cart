# What is this project?
This shopping cart project is a small test project I built to practice using NextJS and Typescript. It's a small _ecommerce-type_ website where a user can select items and add them to their cart. There is no checkout functionality and it is only a single page, but my goal for this project was just to get comfortable with not only using NextJS and Typescript but also with researching how to solve problems with these technologies. I found a few really good resources while trying to fix problems I faced while building this project and I also got more comfortable reading the NextJS documentation. 

# What other technologies did I use?
Besided NextJS and Typescript, I used module css for my styling and redux toolkit for state management. While redux might've been a bit overkill for a projec this simple, it's something that I decided to use in order to keep myself comfortable with it. While deciding to use redux, I was treating this application like how I would a production level application I would work on. 

I chose module css simply because I wanted to try it out and get used to it. I mainly use SASS for all my projects so since I'm learning new technologies with this one, I thought I should switch up my styling as well.
